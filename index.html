    <h3>
      About Me
    </h3>
    <p>
      After receiving a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from
      Carnegie Mellon in 2018, I moved to the beautiful Pacific Northwest to
      begin working as a Microsoft Program Manager. I work in Operating Systems
      security on <a href="#application-control"
        title="skip to Work">application control</a>
      technology, which prevents untrusted programs from running on Windows or
      Linux devices.
      <!-- <br><br>
      I went into cybersecurity because I wanted to work on something impactful
      but couldn't yet envision a career path which was also personally
      meaningful. Carnegie Mellon asks its students to put their hearts into the
      work; once I graduated, mine was free to explore. I made space to heal,
      opening up to my innate curiosity and creativity. I devled into my
      interest areas, learning about (and tasting!) Seattle's plethora of edible
      <a href="#plants" title="skip to Plants">plants</a>
      and probing perspectives on
      <a href="#gender" title="skip to Gender">gender and queerness</a>.
      I pursued a budding interest in
      <a href="#design" title="skip to Design">design.</a>
      For years I had been reading about life's intrinsic
      <a href="#impermanence" title="skip to Impermanence">impermanence, </a>
      and all of the joy and love I was tapping into equipped me to begin
      sitting with my own mortality.
      <br><br>

      In deepening my connection to self, I lifted my self-imposed restrictions
      on what a legitimate, purposeful career could look like. I remain filled
      with gratitude for having a job that puts my skills to use creating
      sorely needed security products.  I also realized that it was entirely
      within my grasp to channel these skills into an area that I love.

      For the past two years, I've been working at Microsoft as a Program
      Manager building security features that help customers defend against
      cyber attacks. Because I am on a highly technical team which traditionally
      works less on customer-facing features than I do, I have been given the
      opportunity and challenge to fill a number of roles: amongst them project
      manager, designer, user researcher, and technical writer.
      <br><br>
      I've grown quickly in my coordination skills from projects which have
      required me to gather dozens of subject matter experts (who were far my
      seniors, came from teams across the company, and often had contradictory
      opinions and goals) and move everyone towards a shared understanding. I've
      had to find answers to quandaries like what to do when I'm running a
      meeting in which two argumentative lead engineers have very different
      ideas about how to solve a problem about which I myself have limited
      knowledge. This has been a difficult but useful crash course in asking
      probing questions, encouraging respectful communication, and creating
      clear expectation-setting— even in environments where this is not the
      norm.
      <br><br>
      I've also had the chance to work directly with customers both to assist
      them in securing their environments and also to get meaningful qualitative
      feedback on my feature area. It's been extremely rewarding to hear about
      where our customers have succeeded in using my feature and knowing that I
      can over time design improvements for the pain points that get in their
      way. Application control is a complex problem space, so I've gotten to sit
      with the question of how to take something which is inherently complicated
      and try to make it approachable.
